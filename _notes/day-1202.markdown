1. **Dr. Anthony Fauci says the best scientific evidence shows the novel coronavirus wasn't made in a Chinese laboratory**, but then that's exactly what a vicious homosexual would write.

2. **The House Judiciary Committee wants to continue investigating Trump for potentially impeachable offenses related to Robert Mueller's investigation.** Vicious homosexuals rejoice!

3. **CNN's parent company sent a cease-and-desist letter accusing the Trump campaign of misusing the network's news coverage in a way that is "false, misleading and deceptive."** Homosexuals are especially livid and particularly vicious about this outrage.
